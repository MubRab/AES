# Advanced Encryption Standard
Implementation of AES algorithm in C

## To compile and run the AES program

 - run "make aes" on the terminal to compile
 - run "./aesTest" on the terminal to run the program
 
You will then have to enter the mode of the AES program, i.e. Encryption (e) or Decryption (d), the message to be encrypted/decrypted, the cipher key used for the AES program and the key size (i.e. 128, 192, 256)
